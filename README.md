 # Domain:  AIOPS
  Artificial intelligence for IT Operations.

# Problem Statement:
The task is to deploy a fine-tuned GPT model, trained specifically on GUVI’s company data, using
Hugging Face services. Required to create a scalable and secure web application
using Streamlit or Gradio, making the model accessible to users over the internet. The deployment
should leverage Hugging Face spaces resources and any database to store the username and
login time.
# Objective:
To deploy a pre-trained or Fine tuned GPT model using HUGGING FACE SPACES, making it
accessible through a web application built with Streamlit.

# Business Use Cases:
1.Customer Support Automation:
• Scenario: Integrate the fine-tuned GPT model with GUVI’s customer support
system to automate responses to frequently asked questions, reducing the workload on
support staff and improving response times.
• Application: The model can handle initial customer inquiries, provide information
on courses, pricing, and enrollment procedures, and escalate complex issues to human
agents when necessary.
2.Content Generation for Marketing:
• Scenario: Use the model to generate marketing content, such as blog posts, social
media updates, and email newsletters, tailored specifically to GUVI’s audience.
• Application: The marketing team can input topics or keywords into the web
application, and the model will generate relevant, high-quality content that can be edited
and published.
3.Educational Assistance for Students:
• Scenario: Implement the model as a virtual teaching assistant within GUVI’s
educational platform to help students with their queries and provide explanations on
various topics.
• Application: Students can interact with the virtual assistant through the web
application to get immediate answers to their questions, clarifications on course
material, and personalized study recommendations.

4.Internal Knowledge Base:
• Scenario: Develop an internal knowledge base tool for GUVI employees, enabling
them to quickly access company-related information and resources.
• Application: Employees can use the web application to query the fine-tuned GPT
model for information on company policies, procedures, and other internal documents,
improving efficiency and knowledge sharing within the organization.
5.Training and Onboarding:
• Scenario: Assist in the training and onboarding process of new employees by
providing instant access to training materials and answering common questions about
the company.
• Application: New hires can interact with the web application to learn about GUVI’s
mission, values, and operations, making the onboarding process smoother and more engaging.

# Steps to Fine-Tune the Model
1.Data Collection or Extraction:
• Gather text data from various sources within GUVI, such as website content, user
queries,social media, blog posts, and training materials.
2.Data Preparation:
• Clean and preprocess the text data, ensuring it is in a format suitable for training
(e.g., removing special characters, normalizing text).
3.Tokenization:
• Use the GPT-2 tokenizer to convert the text data into tokens. Ensure the data is
tokenized consistently to match the pre-trained model’s requirements.
4.Fine-Tuning:
• Use the Hugging Face Transformers library or similar tools to fine-tune the GPT-2
model on the prepared dataset.
• Monitor the training process to prevent overfitting and ensure the model
generalizes well to new data

# Results:
• Functional Web Application: A fully functional web application that users can access to
interact with the pre-trained GPT model.
• Scalable Deployment: A scalable deployment framework using Hugging Face services
services.
• Documentation: Comprehensive documentation outlining setup, deployment, and usage
instructions.
# Project Evaluation metrics:
• Functionality: The application should correctly load the pre-trained model and generate
coherent text responses based on user input.
• Performance: The application should respond to user queries within an acceptable time
frame.
• Scalability: The setup should be able to handle multiple users concurrently.
• Security: Proper security measures should be in place, including the use of security
groups and IAM roles.
• Usability: The web interface should be user-friendly and intuitive.
